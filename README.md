### Description

Add mIRC Forecolors and *Backcolors* to your IRC App. This simply shows you how to set foreground colors and background colors (highlight) in a richtextbox just like mIRC does. I've been searching for something like this for a while, couldn't find it; so decided to write my own. This code is fully commented so you get to see how I did all this. I realize that this may have bugs in it. If so, could you please comment. This is my first submission so be easy on me folks :)

New in version 1.1

- Various bug fixes from 1.0.

- A simple to understand tutorial on RTF Formatting and how I used it in my program.

Vote if you like it. Thanks
